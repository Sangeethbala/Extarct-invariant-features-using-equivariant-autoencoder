# Extarct-invariant-features-using-equivariant-autoencoder

While CNN makes prediction invariant to small translations, it is necessary to have invariances to transformations like rotations and reflections.

Group convolutions are used to achieve equivariance in mappings between each layers in the encoder and decoder.

Invariant features were extracted from the latent space using Average and Gram Pooling.

Latent space was used to train a neural network which showed an improved classification quality.

Description is given in the presentation attached.
